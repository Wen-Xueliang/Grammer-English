    //句子副词通常位于句首(或分句句首)；的句子副词也可用作其他种类的副词，不过这往往会导致位置和语义的变化：

    public static String FORTUNATELY = "fortunately";
    public static String FRANKLY = "frankly";
    public static String GENERALLY = "generally";
    public static String LUCKILY = "luckily";
    public static String MAYBE = "maybe";
    public static String OBVIOUS = "obvious";
    public static String OFFICIALLY = "officially";
}
